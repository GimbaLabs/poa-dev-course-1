# Session 6 | 19 February 2021

## Learning Targets
- I can create dynamic routes by calling on an external API in Next.js
- I can render dynamic routes by calling on an external API in Next.js

## Agenda
- Now that we've created a list of routes, let's fill them in with data!
- First, we'll work with the local data in our ```devs.json``` file.
- Then, we'll call on another Dandelion API to see if we can put some actual metadata on a page.

## Next Steps
Before our next meeting on 24 February 2021:
- Get ready to put some data on the blockchain. Create a .json file with the metadata that you'd like to post.
