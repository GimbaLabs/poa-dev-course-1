```
import styles from '../styles/[your name].module.css'

export default function [your name]() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div class="shape">make me a different shape</div>
      <div class="movement">animate me</div>
      <div class="shadow">add shadows to me</div>
      <div class="text">change this text to your name, then decorate it</div>
